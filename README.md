# Face-mask-detection
Created a model using CNN which classifies that a person has wore a mask or not. The model can work on your webcam and can give prediction with a rectangular box around your face.
If the you had put the mask, it will show a greenbox around your face with label 'with mask'. If you remove your mask it will show 'without mask'.
